# Custom-DatePicker-for-SystemStyle
Chose time&amp;date with system style

Default setting is from 8:00AM to 8:00PM, you can change that in DLPickerView.m		

I dont make that to a more custom controller, cus its easy/little stuff and i dont have too much times, so if you wanna do more, you are welcome
